Wrelks is a toy quantum circuit simulator, forked from [Quirk](http://github.com/Strilanc/Quirk), designed to show how Quantum Gate Matrices are applied to a State/

If you want to quickly see the mathematical operations on Quantum States using gates, then wrecks-quirk is a great starting point for you.

**Defining features**:

- Runs in web browsers.
- Drag-and-drop circuit editing.
- Reacts, displays, and computes in real time.
- States are LaTeX displays

**Notable limitations**:

- Currently only one qubit options available
- Only basic gates such as X,Y,Z, and Hadamard gates can be used.
